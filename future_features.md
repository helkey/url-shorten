## Future Features
So far this Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is designed to demonstrate highly scalable link shortening.
A variety of other features would be necessary to make this a commercially viable product.

<b>Branded domains</b>: Support link shortening for user-customized domain names.

<b>Monetization</b>: As and example, Bitly limits free user to 10k clicks/month, and only 500 clicks/month with a branded domain.
  Their business plan is available for $950 per month.
  Bitly is eying revenue of $100M/year, suggesting a market demand of around 100k professional licenses [BitlyRevenue]
